Playing around with Solid. Kind of like a baby between the svelte compiler & React runtime API. So far love it, performant, tiny, no vdom, no dirty checking. Compiled down to pure imperative JS.

Of course ecosystem isn't large (yet?), but works well with e.g. tailwindcss. Supposed to work with styled as well but haven't given it a go.

Name is a bit confusing, searching for solid js will just show you articles about the SOLID principles... I am willing to bet that this is a major reason why it hasn't gained more traction yet.
